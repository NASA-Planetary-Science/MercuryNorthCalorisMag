Instructions:

First make sure that initialize.m has the correct directory for where you installed the Slepian software package obtained and fully set up from here: https://github.com/Slepian/Slepian

Then:

Edit and run findBestJ.m to calculate all models

Then load the saved file, extract the average coefficients for the desired J value (you can plot the error to decide which one to choose).

Run calcChisqWiecz.m for the coefficients you loaded from the output of fundBestJ to calculate the chi squared map
Save the output in a .mat file.

Then use write2GMT step by step to export the results to GMT

You can find the optimal source depth from an average model using singleSourceDepth.m

Use the GMTscripts in the corresponding folder to create the figures
